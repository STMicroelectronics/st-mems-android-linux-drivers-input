* ais2ih driver for imu MEMS sensors

Required properties for all bus drivers:
- compatible: must be one of:
              "st,ais2ih_input"

Optional properties for all bus drivers (more details reported in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt):
- interrupt-parent = This property is used to specify the controller to
                     which interrupts are routed.
- interrupts =       Interrupts listed here are always in reference to
                     the node's interrupt-parent.

Required properties for the i2c bindings:
- reg: i2c slave address

Required properties for the spi bindings:
- reg:               the chipselect index
- spi-max-frequency: maximal bus speed, should be set to 10000000 unless
                     constrained by external circuitry

Example for an spi device node:

ais2ih-input-acc@0 {
	compatible = "st,ais2ih_input";
	reg = <0x0>;
	spi-max-frequency = <10000000>;
};

Example for an i2c device node with pull down on SD0:

ais2ih-input-acc@18 {
	compatible = "st,ais2ih_input";
	reg = <0x18>;
};

Example for an i2c device node with pull up on SD0:

ais2ih-input-acc@19 {
	compatible = "st,ais2ih_input";
	reg = <0x19>;
};
